Data for asari paper
====================

- asari software code is at https://github.com/shuzhao-li/asari

- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis are here under `notebooks/`.

- The MT02 and SZ22 Datasets are here under `data/`.

- The list of verified NIST SRM 1950 features are here under `data/`.
Potentially redundant isomers are colored. Since the goal here is not metabolite identification, but to test if software detects the presence of a real feature, the isomers are not distinguished in experimental data. 


- The BM21 and HZV029 datasets are available at Metabolomics Workbench (https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org), by IDs ST002233 and ST002454, respectively. 


- The large SLAW dataset (Delabriere et al, 2021) was retrieved from MassIVE (https://massive.ucsd.edu) by study ID MSV000086486.
